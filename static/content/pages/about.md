# Hello, I'm Ahmed Mansour ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Finnish-Egyptian **software engineer**, **entrepreneur**, and **trainer**.

This website is the home of my [blog](/articles).

In my articles I write mainly about how to build web applications that are more user friendly, accessible and performant. I also write non technical articles about recent books I read, productivity tips and new tools.

As an engineer, I have a strong background in IT services consulting working with variety of clients from different industries such as eCommerce, paper, energy, and retail sector. My main focus is web software and typically in my projects I act as a frontend lead engineer.

As an entrepreneur, I am working on creating products that solve problems that I personally encounter and think worth solving. My main projects are [transcriptify](https://www.transcriptify.com) and [nordschool](https://www.nordschool.com)

Some of the areas I have experience with:
- React/Redux
- Vue/Vuex/Nuxt
- Responsive design
- Nodejs
- Serverless architecture
- Typescript/Javascript
- Web performance optimization

As a trainer, I teach the newest web technologies that are used to build scalable fast applications. Find out more [here](https://www.nordschool.com).

As a human, I have two main hobbies - Brazilian Jujutsu & Salsa. Beside that I tend to read a lot of non-fiction books and learn languages.

You can get in touch with me any time, just click [here](/contact) and drop me a message.

The primary place that I share articles, books, new tools, productivity tips and recommendations are through my weekly [newsletter](/newsletter).
