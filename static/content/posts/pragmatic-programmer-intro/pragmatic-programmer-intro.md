There is a great joy in being good at your craft.

It was almost by accident that I noticed about myself that I really enjoy doing something I am good at and doing it as well as I can. So purely for happiness reasons, I started my journey on adopting the craftmanship mentality. I aim to be a little bit better day-by-day that I can ultimately be closer to the best version of myself.

Since one of the things I identify with is being a programmer, the posts series focuses mainly on programming as a craft and working professionally as a programmer. However, in general such a mentality is applicable to many other aspects of life.

One of the great books about the subject is [the pragmatic programmer](). A lot of my takeaways are coming from reading it so a lot of the credit goes to it.

This quote summarizes well what is this all about..
