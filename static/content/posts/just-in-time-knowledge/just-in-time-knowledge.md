The world around us is changing in a fast pace.

In his book [Deep work](https://amzn.to/2DIgRmf), Cal Newport presents the following hypothesis.

In the future there will be generally three types of people who will prosper and be successful:
1- Owners of financial capital, or those with access to it
2- Anyone who quickly can master how to work with intelligent machines and technology
3- Superstars who are very talented in their field of work

I would like to focus on the second point in particular. How to learn **relatively quickly** about operating intelligent machines and technology.

One of the principles that I try to follow is to be constantly learning and developing. Both as a human-being and professionally my craft.

Sometimes, I have found it challenging to choose what to invest my time on in terms of areas to develop further. Of course there are endless interesting books and articles out there that I would love to learn. But which one should I pick now?

## Books per lifetime

As an engineer I like to have data to backup my thinking.

So I asked myself, how many books on average can I possibly read in my lifetime.

Lets do the math quickly:

books per month = 1 - 2 books
books per year = 12 - 24 books
life expectancy where I live (Finland) = 81
I am now in my 20s, years that I will hopefully be reading for = 40 - 50

That would leave me with on average **480 to 1200 books** in my lifetime!

When you think about it, that is actually not that many books.

I came to the conclusion, I really should be thoughtful about which books to read that would give me the **highest return on investment (my time)**

## Timing

I had a discussion with a friend about how to apply learnings from books to real life. While this is a longer discussion, I find a key element here is **timing**

If you give me an amazing book about parenting and how to be a great father but I don't have kids, I won't really learn much from it.

> Good timing increases the odds of you actually applying things you read.

## How-to vs principles books

I generally like to read non-fiction books.

I find that these kind of books can generally be divided into two categories:

- Principles books
- How-to books

Of course it is not that black and white and there are many shades of grey in between.

### Principles books

If I would like to learn about a topic, I generally try first to approach the books that cover the high level timeless principles. This offers to me the big picture and typically these books tackle the **why** side of things.

However, there are thousands of such books published every year. How on earth would I know which one is better?

I try to follow a general rule.

> Start with the books that stood the test of time.

An extreme example of these is something like [Letters from a stoic](https://amzn.to/2ME88Ee) that is around 2000 year old stoic philosophy and still very relevant today.

In general, if a book has been published 5-15 years ago and still recommended it is a probably good book.

### Just in time knowledge

After I am done with learning some of the high level principles and got some answers for my why questions. It would be time for books that focus more on the **how** side of things.

When it come to how-to books. I generally try to save these until there is a real need for them. By real need I mean, **right now or in near future**.

> Just in case knowledge is not really an effective strategy for picking your how-to books.

Remember that a yes to that just in case book means a no to another book that might be more relevant to you right now.

For example, I would avoid reading a book about how to invest in the stock market if I am not planning to do so very soon.

> Just in time knowledge is the most efficient approach to learn practical skills to implement a specific task.

The key here is to practice the art of learning efficiently and quickly.

I found this in particular useful in my field. As a software engineer things change fast, like really fast.

There are so many interesting books on how to use the latest technologies but a balance is needed. A good approach to read more books that focus on timeless principles and read the technical how-to books only when I am about to use that particular tool in my project.

That is it folks, if you would like to discuss further this topic you can find me on twitter. üëç
