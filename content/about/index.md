Hello! 👋🏽

I am Ahmed, a programmer living in Finland.

This blog is home to my thoughts about things that I find interesting.

I work as a freelance full-stack developer. Would you like to collaborate with me? Check out my [work with me page](/work-with-me).

I have built a few things on the internet; check out [my projects page](/projects) for more details.

Want to get in touch? Please reach out at hello@mansour.blog. Feel free to write to me in Arabic, English or Finnish.
