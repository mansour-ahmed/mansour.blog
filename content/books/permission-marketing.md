The book is about a “different” paradigm of marketing. The main idea is that companies should have direct relationship with their consumers. By giving them valuable things they can gain their permission. Marketers should aim to move their consumer from a stranger, to a lifetime customer. In contrast to mass non-targeted marketing, permission marketing is a lot more effective and cheaper but requiee patience and long term thinking. Permission marketing advocate the principle of focusing on your current customers instead of always looking for new prospects.

Overall it was a good read, very relevant for entrepreneurs and companies of all sizes.

Notes:

- Average consumer sees 1 million marketing messages / year & 3000 / day
- It is more expensive (per min) to produce ads than a hollywood movie.
- Human beings have finite attention, money. Interruption marketing have to spend more money to get more attention but the more they spend the less it works.

- Consumers are generally now willing to pay to save time while marketers are willing to pay to get attention.
