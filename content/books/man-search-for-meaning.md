---
The book is written by a psychiatrist who got impresoned in a nazy-German concentration camp. The book focuses on how humans could finding still meaning in their life under such extreme conditions. When we remove all the physical possessions, what really gives our life meaning.

The author comes to a conclusion that meaning can be found through three ways:
- Creating work or doing a deed.
- Experiencing something or encountering someone (through love).
- Attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.

Meaning in life differs from one person to another. The attitude to find meaning is to think that everyone is questioned by life and we must answer by being responsible.

It also beautifully demonstrate that humans are adaptive. A quote that stuck in my head after reading the book was:
 
<br>

> Having a Why to live for enabled them to bear the How.

<br>
The book also highlighted about the importance of acknowledging our ability to make choices regardless of the environment.

It wasn’t an easy read considering some of the details of his story but I really enjoyed reading this book, I highly recommend it!
