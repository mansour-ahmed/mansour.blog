## I quit

On August 2019, I decided to quit my full-time job to pursue entrepreneurship full-time.

Making the decision was not easy and definitely frightening. However, I think it is the right moment to try out this experiment.

The deal breaker for me was the following question:
> When I am 80 and reflecting back on my life, which one would I regret more, trying out entrepreneurship or sticking to keeping things the way it was?

So as long as I am taking a calculated risk, I should give the experiment a go.

## My Whys

Some of my motivations to try this entrepreneurship experiment are:

#### Provide Value
<span class="highlight">Provide the highest value possible</span> to people. 

Entrepreneurship, as a way of living, seems to be an effective way to provide highest value to our society. My main long term goal is to be as useful as possible to the world.

#### Get out of the time selling business
Entrepreneurship is a potential medium for me to <span class="highlight"> sell value instead of my time.</span>

A typical wealth equation for most of us: 

> Financial Reward = hourly rate x hours (value magnititude x hours)

This has two limitations:
- A hard limit on hourly rate on average (unless you are a world class performer in something).
- Time is not scalable. Theorically you have maximum of 24 hours per day to work.

I would like to change the time-based salary model and instead remove time from the equation and maximise the value magnititude I can provide.

I hope to move to this wealth equation instead:

> Financial Reward = net profit + asset value (value magnititude x value scale)

#### Flexibility 
I would like to have a career that gives me the highest amount of <span class="highlight">flexibility in my life</span>.

I would like to eventually have a business that is:
- Location-independant.
- 100% control over my time.
- 100% autonomy on the tasks I work on.

#### Creativity
Entrepeneurship can create the environment that maximise <span class="highlight">creativity and learning new skills</span> that are not necessary in my "field".

Society seem to promote specialisation and for people to become specalisits. However, the world is changing quickly and being able to adapt new skills is important.  

The specialisation narritive limits people's preception of what they are capable of. I personally would like to believe that I am capable of developing useful skills that migth be outside my field of software development. 


## Initial plan

The common narritive (in my bubble) when it comes to entrepreneurship is that one should aim to create a startup and look for investors and grow it until they can sell their company or go IPO. 

However, for me I don't think this will be the best approach. I would like to be more of a solo-preneur and invest my own resources to grow my own business.

After a long thinking process I have decided to pursue 3 tracks for the beginning - Teaching, Own product, Freelancing.

But...

> Everybody have a plan until they are punched in the face. - Mike Tyson 

For now I would like to go in that direction. However, As I learn more my plan will definitely change. 

#### Coding Instructor - [Nordschool](https://www.nordschool.com)

Based on feedback, I tend to be a good communicator so I would like to experiment with online teaching.

Combing one of my crafts as a software developer & being a communicator, I can provide some value to people.

I am starting to create online technical material related to web development. 

The initial thought is to create a teaching platform called [Nordschool](https://www.nordschool.com) where I can share my material in term of free & paid courses.

#### Own Product - Nordgigs

As an entrepreneur, I aim to focus my energy solving some problems I care about.

In Finland where I live, I see more people (at least in my bubble) moving to the gig eceonomy. However, there seem to be a lack of online services that facilitate easily matching the supply & demand for freelancers.

I am exploring this space where I might be able to provide value to other entrepreneurs. 

The initial thought is to create an online job board where companies that are looking to hire freelancers can advertise their need and entrepreuenrs can sign up and receive instant notification when something interesting shows up.

#### Freelancing

Since I am a web developer, I will be dedicating some of my time per year for freelance projects in Finland and remotely.

Since building an own brand or product is a long term game, I think freelancing may smoothen the ride and allow me to pursue my other projects long term without much financial pressure.
