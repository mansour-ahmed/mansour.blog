description: Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well? My notes about being better at my craft as a programmer.
---

There is a great joy in being good at your craft.

Almost accidentally, I made an observation about myself. I really **enjoy** doing things that I feel like I am good at. I get a sense of joy from doing these things as well as I can. So purely for happiness reasons, I started my journey on adopting a craftsmanship mentality.

<p id="kaizen">
There is a Japanese concept called <strong>kaizen</strong>. The concept emphasizes the continuous improvement of a system by eliminating what is called <strong>muda</strong> (waste) through a lot of very small changes.
</p>


I aim to follow this concept to be a little bit better day-by-day that I can ultimately be closer to the best version of myself.

This post series focuses mainly on the craft of writing code and working professionally as a programmer since it is one of the things I identify with. However, such a mentality is applicable to many other aspects of life.

A great books about tht subject is [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://amzn.to/2VXGCFL). A lot of my takeaways are coming from reading it so some credit is due to the book and its authors.

This quote summarizes well what this is all about..
