# Hello! I'm Ahmed Mansour, nice to meet you ü§ù

I'm a **software engineer**, **entrepreneur**, and **coding instructor** living in Helsinki Finland.

This website is the home of my [blog](/).

In my articles, I write mainly about how to build web applications that are more user-friendly, accessible and performant. I also write non-technical articles about recent books I read, productivity tips and new tools.

As an engineer, I have a strong background in IT services consulting working with a variety of clients from different industries such as eCommerce, paper, energy, and retail sector. My main focus is web software and typically in my projects I act as a frontend lead engineer.

Some of the areas I have experience with:

- React/Redux
- Vue/Vuex/Nuxt
- Headless CMS
- Nodejs
- Serverless web architecture

As an entrepreneur, I am working on creating products that solve problems that I encounter and think worth solving. My main projects are [Nordgigs](https://www.nordgigs.com) and [Nordschool](https://www.nordschool.com) (both are work in progress at the moment).

As a coding instructor, I teach the newest web technologies that are used to build scalable fast applications. Find out more [here](/work-with-me#teaching).

You can find out more about how we can collaborate [here](/work-with-me).

As a human, I have two main hobbies - Brazilian Jujutsu & Salsa dancing. Besides that, I tend to read a lot of non-fiction books and learn (human) languages. You can find my bookshelf [here](/bookshelf)

You can get in touch with me any time, just click [here](/contact) and drop me a message.

The primary place that I share articles, books, new tools, productivity tips, and recommendations is through my weekly [newsletter](/newsletter). Sign up now and you will get the very next newsletter.
