Need a software developer for your project? I can help!

I am an experienced software developer who can help you deliver the digital solutions your customers deserve. When we work together, I make sure we build high-performance web apps that offer a delightful experience to your users.

I enjoy team collaboration but can work independently. As a developer, I care about my craft, so expect clean, maintainable code following the industry best practices.

Some of the technologies I am comfortable working with:
* React
* Node
* Typescript
* Azure
* Contentful
* PostgreSQL

Currently, I'm working full-time on a project until May 2022. Maybe afterwards we can collaborate? Let's talk! üëâüèΩ  projects@mansour.blog
